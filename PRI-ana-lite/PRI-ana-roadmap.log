##########	PRI-analyzer-lite Roadmap Log

########## Improvements of existing code 

- increase modularity of GUI main into functions
* add separate functions for pre/post selection - might be overkill
* add single function for plotting or pdf generation - done

- might need some class vars in Main-GUI for cutoff display + saving
* calculated thresholds
* selected markers cols
* IDEA: 
**create class vars outside and assign value to local var inside bind functions
** only assign back to class var at output/final state of local var

- BUG: saving thresholds before they are calculated should be catched
- BUG: saved cutoffs are extracted but not displayed in text fields

- fix positioning of marker checkboxes - fixed via dynamic marker field creation
* implement dynamic field number with fixed num of markers per field - done
* conversion of all pack into grid (emulate Yens approach) - not needed
* or get damned pack to work! - works now

- change plotting to plot a single Hist and do par() etc outside - fixed

- General Optimizations/Coding
* add procedure prints/flags - done

- BUG: subscript out of bounds error with some markers (same error in PRI-ANA) - fixed
- saving cutoffs should only re-calculate them if they havent been calculated yet
* via class var
* either flag or other (avoid saving previously calculated cutoffs)


########## Implementations to do

- plotting functions - done
* plot single histogram of thresholds - done
* plot multiple histograms - done
* values are different to PRI-ANA + no cutoffs found! - fixed 
* check for pdf or just plot - done
* add title and dates automatically - done

- calculation functions for thresholds
* emulate existing from PRI-ana - done
* trimming and doublets?
* add new ones 

- add storage/database manipulation 
* save created thresholds - done
* extract existing thresholds - done but not displayed yet
* reload last used database - not needed (dynamic initial dir is fine)

- GUI additions
* select/deselect all markers - done
* restore thresholds

- Automation 
* what to automate?

- add PRI log field - done
